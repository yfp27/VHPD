<h2 style="font-family: lora, sans-serif;"><font color="brown"><font size="-0px">Situated:<font color="yellow"><font size="-0px">Situated:Ahsan Manzil is located on the banks of the river Buriganga in the Kumartuli area of Islampur in Old Dhaka . It was formerly the residential palace of the Nawabs of Dhaka and the Sadar Kachari of the zamindari. It is currently being used as a museum. It was founded by Nawab Abdul Gani . He named it after his son Khwaja Ahsanullah . A meeting held here in 1906 decided to establish the Muslim League . Ahsan Manzil has been renovated several times. The latest reforms have been made very recently. It is now a museum run by the Bangladesh National Museum.</font></h2><br>
<h2 style="font-family:robato, sans-serif"><font color="brown"><font size="-0px">History:</font></h2>
<h2 style="font-family:lora, sans-serif"><font color="black"><font size="-0px">In the middle of the eighteenth century, Sheikh Inayetullah Ahsan, the zamindar of Jamalpur [2] Pargana, built a recreation building called Rangmahal on the present site of the manzil. Later, his son Sheikh Matiullah sold the Rangmahal to French merchants. It has long been known as a trading post. Then in 1830 Khwaja Alimullah, the father of Nawab Abdul Ghani , who lived in Begum Bazar , bought it and started living there. At the center of this residence was a master plan drawn up by Khwaja Abdul Gani Martin & Company, a European construction and engineering company, whose main building was Ahsan Manzil. In 1859, Nawab Abdul Ghani , the palace was completed in 1872, which began construction. He is his favorite sonIt was named 'Ahsan Manzil' after Khwaja Ahsanullah . At that time the newly built palace building was known as Rangmahal and the old building was known as Andarmahal. [3]

The whole of Ahsan Manzil was severely damaged by a strong earthquake on 6 April 18. The existing high dome was added during the reconstruction of the damaged Ahsan Manzil. High quality bricks were brought from Raniganj for reconstruction and repair. Engineer Govinda Chandra Roy conducted the repair work. [3] At that time, Dhaka city did not have such a magnificent building as Ahsan Manzil. The dome above its palace was one of the highest peaks in the city, attracting attention from afar.

When the earthquake hit Dhaka on 12 June 1897, the Ahsan Manzil was severely damaged. The Nahabat Khana adjacent to Islampur Road along the south verandah of Ahsan Manzil completely collapsed. Later Nawab Ahsanullah rebuilt it. [1] [4] In 1952, the Dhaka Nawab Estate was acquired by the government under the Zamindari Eviction Act. But the residential buildings of the Nawabs, the Ahsan Manzil and the garden houses are out of acquisition. Over time, due to lack of funds and the influence of the Nawab's family, the maintenance of Ahsan Manzil became difficult. In the 1960s, members of the Nawab's family bought valuables at auction.(Info source:different websites)</font></h2>

<h2 style="font-family:robato, sans-serif"><font color="brown"><font size="-0px">Situated:<font color="white"><font family="lora, sans-serif"><font size="-0px">Lalbagh Fort (Kila Aurangabad) is an unfinished Mughal fort located on the banks of the river Buriganga in the south-west of Dhaka.Its construction began in 17 AD , by the Mughal subahdar Muhammad Azam Shah , who was the son of Emperor Aurangzeb and later became emperor himself. His successor, Mughal subaddar Shaista Khan , resumed construction in 180, but did not finish.</font></h2><br>
<h2 style="font-family:robato, sans-serif"><font color="brown"><font size="-0px">history:</font></h2>
<h2 style="font-family: lora, sans-serif"><font color="black"><font size="-0px">Azam Shah, the 3rd son of Emperor Aurangzeb, the Mughal prince, started its construction in 16 AD while he was the subaddar of Bengal. He was in Bengal for 15 months. Before the construction of the fort was completed, his father Emperor Aurangzeb summoned him to Delhi to quell the Maratha rebellion . At this time , after the construction of a mosque and a court hall, the construction of the fort stopped. Subaddar Shaista Khan came to Dhaka again in 180 AD as the subadar of Bengal and resumed the construction of the fort. In 184, Rahmat Banu (Peri Bibi), daughter of Shaista Khan, died here. After the death of his daughter, Shaista Khan considered the fort a misfortune and stopped its construction unfinished in 164 AD.One of the three main installations of Lalbagh fort is the tomb of Pari Bibi. It lost its popularity after Shaista Khan left Dhaka. The capital was shifted from Dhaka to Murshidabad; This was the main reason. The fort remained abandoned after the end of the royal Mughal period. In 1844 the area was renamed "Lalbagh" after "Aurangabad" and the fort became Lalbagh Fort.(Info source:different websites)</font></h2>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7AVOrlm.jpeg" alt="বাহাদুর শাহ park" width="500" height="333">
<h2 style="font-family:robato, sans-serif"><font color="brown"><font size="-0px">Situated:</font><font color="yellow"><font family="lora, sans-serif"><font size="-0px">Bahadur Shah Park in Bangladesh 's capital, Dhaka, in the Old City area Sadarghat near Lakshmi is a historic place where a park has been set up. This place has witnessed many historical events.</font><br>
<h2 style="font-family:robato, sans-serif"><font color="brown">History:<br><font color="black"><font family="lora, sans-serif"><font size="-0px">It was bought by the English in the first half of the nineteenth century. [1] They turned it into a park and surrounded it with iron and placed four spectacular cannons at its four corners. Soon after the place became dilapidated, it was demolished and a field was built on the initiative of Nawab Abdul Gani. [ Citation needed ] Many Armenians still lived around it. Even in 1840 it was a circular garden (according to James Taylor) in a vacant lot in the middle of a few streets.

The patrons of the clubhouse were Nawab Abdul Gani and Nawab Ahsan Ullah of Dhaka. In addition to billiards, the English used to play tennis, badminton and hang out at the club. Party functions were also organized here. According to the history and old documents of Dhaka Club, Dhaka Club had one acre of land near Antaghar Maidan (Sutrapur Mouza: Khatian: 614, Plot 64-65). According to the old employees, the Dhaka Club used to pay rent for three acres of land in the area till 1952. In the twenties of the twentieth century, as the power and influence of the Nawabs of Dhaka waned, so did their contributions to the club. The English moved the Dhaka Club to the Shahbagh area for organizing horse races at the racecourse ground in Dhaka and for other needs.

This ground gained special fame in 1857. On 22 November 1757, the British Marines attacked the fort at Lalbagh in Dhaka with the aim of disarming the native troops. But when the sepoys obstructed, the war broke out. Soldiers wounded and fleeing the war were captured and convicted by a brief court-martial and sentenced to death. After the trial, 11 sepoys were brought to Antaghar Maidan and hanged in public. The corpses have been hanging from trees here for many days to intimidate the locals. For a long time after this incident, the people of Dhaka were afraid to walk around this ground, because various ghost stories were spread about this place. After suppressing the sepoy rebellion, the British erected a monument at Antaghar Maidan in memory of their troops.

The Armenian club later raised four British cannons at the four corners of the house and placed them around the park. Nawab Abdul Gani had a personal contribution in the development of this park. After the death of his grandson Khwaja Hafizullah, his English friends raised money in memory of Mr. Hafizullah and erected a memorial plaque here in 184. [1]

In 1956, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Sepoy Mutiny, a memorial was erected at this place on the initiative of the Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT).(Info source:different websites)</font>

<h2 style="font-family:robato, sans-serif"><font color="brown"><font size="-0px">history:</font>
<h2 style="font-family:lora, sans-serif"><font color="black"><font size="-0px">In 1874, Indian Governor Thomas George Baring, Lord Northbrook, the Viceroy of India between 1872 and 1876, came to visit Dhaka. In order to make his visit memorable, Raja Rai Bahadur, along with eminent Zamidars and affluent citizens of Dhaka, donated 10 thousand and 5 thousand taka each to build the Town Hall in 1879. Abhay Chandra Das was the committee secretary. In 1880, the Commissioner of Dhaka inaugurated it and the personal orchestra of Nawab Abdul Ghani was brought to entertain the commissioner and the guests on inauguration.

On 8 February 1882, a public library was added on the south-east side of the Hall. It was named the Northbrook Public Library and became known for its literary collection. Many books were ruined during the 1971 Liberation War. To re-establish the library, the Maharaja of Tripura donated 1000 TK, the Zamidar of Baliati Brojendro Kumar Roy 1000 TK, Queen Shornomoi 700 TK, Kalikhrishno 500 TK and Bishaishori Devi donated 500 TK. In 1887, the library opened with 1000 books.

A clubhouse was added to the south-side and called Johnson Hall. At Northbrook Hall, Nobel Laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore was honoured by Dhaka Municipality and the People's Association on 7 February 1926. In 1950, Northbrook Hall was used as a telegram office, and later as the Central Women's College. The building is the property of Dhaka Municipality Corporation.[1][2](Info source:different websites)</font></p>

Imambara in his enlarged Abul Kalam Mohammad Zakaria in his book 'Bangladesh's Antiquities' mentions the inscription on the wall of the building. Archaeologists have examined the inscription and found that it was not a forgery. The inscription mentions the name of Mir Murad as the creator. Historian M Hassan Dani also said, 'Mir Murad was the first to set up a small Imambara here. Later it was demolished and rebuilt by the Naib-Nazims. Historian James Taylor mentions in his book that the original Imambara survived in 1832. During the period of East India Company, Imambara was reformed in two phases. The building was almost destroyed in the earthquake of 1897. Later Khwaja AhsanullahHe spent lakhs of rupees to rebuild and renovate it. The southern pond was renovated once in 1995 and again in 2011. In 2011, Purrahoseni Dalan Imambara was renovated and beautified.</font></h2>
